This summer I wanted to delve into the weeds of shader programming.  I also wanted to explore the capabilities of browser based rendering so I amalgamated a bunch of random experiments into a strange professional website. 

Many thanks to <a href="https://github.com/tsherif">Tarek Sherif</a> for the awesome <a href="https://github.com/tsherif/picogl.js?files=1">picogl library</a>.  I strongly recommend it to anyone interested in learning intermediate graphics programming concepts.  It abstracts away the pedantry of raw WebGL while still exposing the fundementals of GPU state management.

The physics of the cloth simulation behind the fake resume was <a href="https://tsherif.github.io/picogl.js">implemented by Tarek</a> and I reverse engineered his design to include cuttability/flammability.
